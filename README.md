  vsSimFTVS generates FT-VS pulses and performs spatial and velocity Bloch Simulations of magnetization after these pulses.
  
  vsSimOrig generates VS pulses based on a BIR-8 sub-pulse train (designed by Guo et al, MRM, 2015) and performs spatial and       velocity Bloch Simulations of magnetization after these pulses.  
  
  RUN_FVTS_OPT optimizes sub-pulse amplitudes of the proposed FT-VS pulse
  
  RUN_VSORIG_OPT optimizes various pulse parameters of the BIR-8 velocity selective pulse
